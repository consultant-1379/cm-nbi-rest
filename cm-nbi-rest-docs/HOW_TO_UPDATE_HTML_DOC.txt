To produce html doc page we use REST2HTML ericsson tool at https://elib.internal.ericsson.com/
This tool is able to accept 2 different formats packaged as zip file:
- open api (as single yaml file) 
- raml (as single yaml file + its subfolders/files)

Cause raml format seems obsolete, we decided to describe our CM-REST- NBI interface as single open api file (written in yaml format ttps://swagger.io/specification/) 
We are able to validate it via IDEA plugin or via Sqagger onlide editor https://editor.swagger.io/

Note: due to REST2HTML conversion problem, we had to generate static html file starting from raml format
So when we change openapi, to produce new html doc file, we have to:
1) update raml file accordingly
2) generarate new html file with REST2HTML tool using that raml file
